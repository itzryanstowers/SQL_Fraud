# SQL_Fraud

* This analysis focuses on detecting potential fraudulent transactions by examining spending patterns for specific cardholders.

## Goal Objectives

*By leveraging SQL queries and visual analytics, this investigation aims to:

- Analyze transaction trends for selected cardholders.
- Identify anomalies by comparing spending behaviors.
- Visualize transaction patterns to support fraud detection efforts.

## Approach

1. Query Transactional Data: I will be using SQL to extract transaction history for both cardholders that have potential fraud issues

2. Time Series Analysis: Perform time series analysis on spending behavior over time

3. Data Visualization: Generate plots and visuals to better identify potential anomolies

4. Fraud Detection?: Come to a conclusion to identify if there are potential fraudulant or suspicious activity based on findings.


## Potential Results/ Additions

* Through this analysis, we explored transaction trends and spending behaviors for specific cardholders to identify potential fraudulent activity. By leveraging SQL queries and visual analytics, we uncovered patterns that could indicate unusual spending behavior. The next steps could involve implementing machine learning models for anomaly detection, refining fraud detection thresholds, or integrating real-time monitoring systems to enhance financial security.
